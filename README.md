A pure-rust implementation of CITP aka Controller Interface Transport Protocol.
CITP is an open communications protocol for the integration of visualisers,
lighting consoles and media servers.

## Features

This implementation aims to implement the full CITP protocol as the
specification describes. The spec can be found at
[citp-protocol.org](http://www.citp-protocol.org/viewtopic.php?f=1&p=752&sid=ba74a80bacbb71baa8c655659063cd69#p752).

- The **protocol** module describes all constants and types within the
  specification and provides **WriteBytes** and **ReadBytes** traits for writing
  and reading any of these types to and from arrays of bytes.

  Each layer of the protocol is implemented under its own `protocol` sub-module.
  - [x] `protocol::pinf`
  - [x] `protocol::sdmx`
  - [x] `protocol::fptc`
  - [x] `protocol::fsel`
  - [x] `protocol::finf`
  - [ ] `protocol::msex`

- [ ] The **net** module provides an implementation of the necessary
  broadcasting, multicasting, UDP and TCP streams described within the protocol
  for communication of the protocol over a network.

- **Further Work**:
  - [ ] Types for listening to and iterating over received broadcast/multicast
    messages.
  - [ ] Examples for demonstrating basic usage of each part of the protocol.
  - [ ] Tests that write and then read every type within the protocol to ensure
    correctness of the **WriteToBytes** and **ReadFromBytes** implementations.
